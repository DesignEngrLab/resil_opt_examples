# Cooling Tank Problem

This folder demonstrates the optimization of the design buffer and resilience policy of a cooling tank. 

The simulation for this model was developed in fmdtools. To install this toolkit and the required dependencies, use 'pip install fmdtools' or see https://github.com/DesignEngrLab/fmdtools.

The files in this folder are:
- Tank Optimization.ipynb, which is a jupyter notebook that demonstrates the simulation and optimization of the tank system
- tank_opt.py, which contains the algorithms and objective functions for the model
- tank_model.py, which is the model file for the Tank system.
